        <p>
          We’d love to help you, but the reality is that not every question gets
          answered. To improve your chances, here are some tips:
        </p>

        <h4>Search, and research</h4>
        <p>
          Have you thoroughly searched for an answer before asking your question?
          Sharing your research helps everyone. Tell us what you found (on this site
            or elsewhere) and why it didn’t meet your needs. This demonstrates that
            you’ve taken the time to try to help yourself, it saves us from reiterating
            obvious answers, and above all, it helps you get a more specific and
            relevant answer!
